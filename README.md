# Project Overview

Using ROS, a TurtleBot was programmed in Python to navigate to the four
corners of the small lab used during testing. The map of the lab was
created using the built-in GMapping package to construct the map, and
SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping) to navigate. The video of
the robot navigating the lab can be seen below.
